Firefox addon that generates TOTPs for 2 factor authentication

This addon shows TOTPs (Timed One Time Passwords) for accounts set up with 2 Factor Authentication/2 Step Verification.  
Enter the site name and secret key in the addon's options page and click save to add a site.  
The code will appear in the toolbar icon. The copy button copies the code and the delete button removes the code.  
The JSON box in the options page can be used for backup/restore.

This addon uses [JS-OTP](https://github.com/jiangts/JS-OTP/) to generate the codes.  
The icons are from [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/).
